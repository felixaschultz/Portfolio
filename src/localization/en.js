            introduction: 'I have a passion for front end web development. I have worked for more than 10 years with website development, the first 5 years just as a hobby alongside school. The last 5 years have focused me to go full professional into web development. I am in the process of expanding my skills in ReactJS.',

                description: `In 2016, at the age of 18, I was diagnosed with kidney disease, I was told when I got to the hospital that I only had a kidney function of 3%. I had to fight for my life for 3.5 years with a botched operation, an illness like a virus. In July 2019, I was finally transplanted without complications. In 2020 I started my education as a multimedia designer and finished it in 2022 with a grade 12.
                In my free time, I like to go out with my camera and drone and record some video clips and pictures around me and nature. I also like to watch series & movies in my spare time, at the same time I can find myself developing a bit too much fun on various hoppy projects or other small things.
                In August 2023, I have started my Professional Bachelor in Web Development at Erhvervsakademiet Aarhus, after I completed my Multimedia Designer education in 2022.`
